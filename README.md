# InvestmentHeatMap

This is an interactive heatmap that allows users to compare 3 different types of metrics - Real GDP, Industrial Production and Retail Sales across
3 different regions - US, UK and China. The widgets allow users to customise how they wish to view the data eg. YoY vs QoQ, with customisable end dates and lookback periods.
This allows users to gain a better understanding of the overall macroeconomic conditions in these areas with the possibility for comparison, aiding in investment decisions.
