Also, it was quite difficult to find the relevant data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. However, one thing to note was that for industrial production, the data for US and UK is an index but that is not the case for the data about China. Also, there are varying units for the different data but since the heatmap is to show the percentage changes QoQ and YoY, this should not be a big issue"
